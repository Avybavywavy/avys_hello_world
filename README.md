# avys_hello_world
"Hello friend, that's lame. Maybe I should give a name. NO! That's a slippery slope."
    In all seriousness "Hello World!" I'm Avy and I have a lot of stupid hobbies, one of them being programming.
  Random question but why on earth does github have three like, 'user information' pages. Anyway that's whatever idekncbtw.
  I have always liked computers and building things in general (as well as breaking them but like, how are you going to know how something works without breaking it first),
  anyway I have always been creative, I remember making little board games as a child because I deemed everything that already existed "inadequet" I guess; I enjoy creating novel solutions to problems and understanding systems at a deeper level
  so I suppose that I was cut out for this. I also make music, I have always liked music but I guess that that's another story.

    I enjoy learning in general so I've bounced around a lot of different hobbies, some lasted for a week other for months but for some reason my brain craves building knowledge in general.
  I've dabbled in speed solving rubick's cubes, skateboarding (wasn't very good at it), drawing (gave up when I realized it's actually boring asf if you actually wanna be good at it), music (one of my passions), 
  programming (something I have learned to love the process of as well), photography, journaling, and philosophy.
    
    Anywho that's enough of that because github is mostly a platform for programmers so I'll talk about that I guess. {WIP}
