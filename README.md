In all seriousness "Hello World!" I'm Avy and I have a lot of stupid hobbies, one of them being programming.
I have always liked computers and building things in general (as well as breaking them but like, how are you going to know how something works without breaking it first),

anyway I have always been creative, I remember making little board games as a child because I deemed everything that already existed "inadequet" I guess; I enjoy creating novel solutions to problems and understanding systems at a deeper level
so I suppose that I was cut out for this. I also make music, I have always liked music since childhood but I guess that that's another story.

I enjoy learning in general so I've bounced around a lot of different hobbies, some lasted for a week other for months but for some reason my brain craves building knowledge in general. I've dabbled in speed solving rubick's cubes, skateboarding (wasn't very good at it), drawing (gave up when I realized it's actually boring asf if you actually wanna be good at it), music (one of my passions), programming (something I have learned to love the process of as well), photography, journaling, and philosophy.

This is the quintessential First Program every aspiring Computer scientist builds, literally nothing special at all but like rites of passage and all of that I guess.
